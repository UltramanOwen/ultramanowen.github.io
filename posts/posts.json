        "content": "\"Bootstraps\" refer to the loops sewn at the top of a boot, which can be used to pull the boot on. The phrase \"pull oneself up by one's bootstraps\" metaphorically means to improve one's situation through one's own efforts without any outside help. In computing, \"bootstrapping\" refers to the process of starting up a computer system. This involves loading a small, initial program (bootstrap program) into memory, which then loads a more complex operating system. The term \"boot\" is derived from this process."
